# Routes
# This file defines all application routes (Higher priority routes first)
# ~~~~

# An example controller showing a sample home page
GET     /                           controllers.HomeController.index


# Map static resources from the /public folder to the /assets URL path
GET     /assets/*file               controllers.Assets.versioned(path="/public", file: Asset)


#Play also comes with a legacy static routes generator that works with controllers that declare actions as static methods. This is generally not recommended because it breaks encapsulation, makes code less testable, and is incompatible with many of Playâ€™s new APIs.
